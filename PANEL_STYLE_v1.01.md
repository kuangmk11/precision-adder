# Front panel style

**Version 1.01.**

House style for my module front panels — what marks go on them, what each one means, and
where it sits. It is a drawing spec, not a program: a panel is in the style if it satisfies
the rules below, whether it was generated or drawn by hand.

The look is borrowed from RYO's *Altered States* (`reference.jpg`) and is deliberately
PCB-native: single-weight plotter lettering, connections routed the way a trace is routed,
and dots where a silkscreen would have vias. Printed as white silkscreen on black
soldermask.

The rules were fitted to a set of eleven generated Kassutronics panels. That is where the
numbers come from, and why some are stated to the hundredth of a millimetre — they were
measured off production artwork, not chosen.

## Two ways to draw one

**Generated.** One `<stem>.layout.json` per panel says what its controls are and how they
relate; every mark comes from a single style library, so changing a number there changes
every panel at once.

```sh
tools/build_styled_panels.sh            # every finished layout
tools/build_styled_panels.sh Slope      # just the ones whose path matches
```

Outputs land beside each source as `<stem>.styled.{panel.json,kicad_pcb,svg}`, leaving the
PDF-derived conversions untouched.

**Drawn.** A hand-written SVG at 1:1, one user unit = 1 mm — `docs/v3-panel.svg` in this
repo is one. Nothing below needs a generator; the tokens are just numbers.

Where a rule is easier to state as tool behaviour ("the composer refuses to write if…"), it
is stated here as the rule being enforced. A generator should enforce it. A hand drawing has
to be checked.

## The one rule that is not negotiable

**Control hole positions are inherited, never computed.**

A panel serving a board that already exists — a port of someone else's module, or a revision
like this adder's v3 — takes its hole positions from that board and may not move them. A
panel whose holes move stops fitting its main board. v3 reassigns hole *diameters* between
6 mm jack and 5 mm toggle and keeps all sixteen positions from the built v2.2 panel.

On a genuinely new board the positions are fitted once, when the board is laid out, and are
inherited from then on.

Either way, **every hole is accounted for**, so a jack cannot silently vanish because a
layout forgot it.

Mounting holes are the exception: they meet the rails, not the module's own board, so they
are regenerated (below).

## Tokens

Every value is one number in one place. A generator holds them together; a hand drawing
copies them from here.

| | value | |
|---|---|---|
| `LINE_W` / `RULE_W` | 0.25 / 0.20 mm | wires, brackets, rings / centre divider |
| `LABEL_SIZE` / `PITCH_LABEL` | 2.0 / 2.2 mm | control labels |
| `SMALL_SIZE` / `PITCH_SMALL` | 1.6 / 1.7 mm | crowded rows, notes, bracket labels |
| `TITLE_SIZE` / `PITCH_TITLE` | 3.2 / 3.4 mm | module name |
| `LOGO_SIZE` / `PITCH_LOGO` | 1.3 / 1.45 mm | wordmark |
| `TRAVEL_DOT_D` / `TRAVEL_END_D` | 0.9 / 1.4 mm | knob travel marks |
| `DOT_D` | 0.6 mm | star-field, when used at all |
| `RING_GAP` | 1.2 mm | output ring stands off the hole edge |
| `EDGE_MARGIN` | 0.6 mm | no silkscreen closer than this to the cut |

**Tracking.** The reference's lettering is monospaced and widely tracked; stroke fonts
(Newstroke, and most plotter faces) are proportional, and KiCad has no letter-spacing
setting. So text is set **one character at a time** on a fixed pitch, each centred in its
own cell. Everything is uppercase.

## Marks and what they mean

**Knob travel — a dotted arc.** Eleven dots every 30°, at every position except +90°; the
gap at the bottom is where the label goes and the two dots either side of it, at +120° and
+60°, are the ends of travel and are drawn heavier. These positions are not invented: they
are measured off the starbursts on the ASR, both Attenumix panels and the Avalanche VCO,
which all draw the same 300° pot. The radius sits inside the band that artwork occupies —
3.75 to 8.06 mm on a 7.5 mm pot — so the marks stay visible with a knob fitted.

```
        ·  ·  ·               11 dots, r = hole_r + 3.45
      ·         ·
    ·     (O)     ·           hole
      ·         ·
     ●           ●            heavy: ends of travel, +120 / +60
          FOLD                the 30 deg gap at +90
```

- a **small** knob pulls the radius in for tightly spaced rows (Slope's Shape/Sustain sit on
  13.3 mm centres);
- a **big** knob draws **two** concentric rings, for an oversized main knob whose starburst
  runs out to 18.5 mm rather than 8.5 — the 3340 and KS-20 Frequency, the Ladder Filter, the
  Wavefolder's Fold;
- **bipolar** adds a heavier dot at 12 o'clock for the centre detent, and sets `-` / `+`
  outside the travel ends;
- **named ends** do the same with words, for the KS-20's `LP` / `HP` Mode.

**A ring means signal leaves here.** Every jack is an input or an output, and an output
draws the ring. Keeping it the only closed circle on a panel is what lets direction read at
a glance — which is also why nothing else may be a closed circle.

**A bracket groups one direction only.** It says *these belong together*, so enclosing an
input and an output in one misstates the signal flow. A bracket that mixes directions is an
error, not a judgement call. Labels sit in gaps in the bracket's own top edge. An output row
inside a bracket does not also get rings — the bracket already says it.

**An outline groups by function, not direction.** A plain rounded box at the lighter rule
weight, drawn round everything belonging to one section — the Quantizer's two channels, each
of which necessarily has both an input and an output, so the bracket's one-direction rule
does not apply. Where a bracket labels a row in its own top edge and must not mix
directions, an outline just says *this lot is one thing*.

**A span is one shared label** over a bar covering the controls it names, with a tick turning
down at each end — the 3340's two V/Oct inputs get one word, not the same word twice.

**A wire is a connection**, routed with one knee using only 0°, 90° and 45° segments,
stopping short of what it joins and breaking around any label it passes under. Routing does
**not** avoid obstacles: check that a wire does not cross a control, or drop it.

## Layout

Labels go **above** jacks and LEDs, **below** pots and switches, measured from whatever is
drawn around the hole — a pot's travel ring, an output's ring — not from the hole itself.

Three things adjust themselves and should not be fought:

- a row whose labels would collide, or would need shoving back inside the board, drops to the
  small size **as a whole row**;
- every label in a row is snapped to one baseline, so a ringed output does not sit 1.2 mm
  below its plain neighbours;
- the title shrinks to fit the clear span between the mounting slots.

When a row still needs help, in the order to reach for it: the small size, a larger label
gap, the label moved to a named direction, the label placed at an explicit `[x, y]`. An
explicit title height and size exist for panels where a control near the top leaves only
~2 mm of clear band.

## Mounting

Regenerated to one rule, as 6.4 × 3.2 mm obround slots milled on Edge.Cuts — horizontal, so
a module can slide ±1.6 mm to meet its neighbours.

| | |
|---|---|
| vertical | centre 3.0 mm from the top and bottom edges |
| horizontal | centre 7.5 mm in from the edge; the opposite column steps out by N × 5.08 mm |
| **> 6 HP** | both columns, 4 slots — 8 HP at 7.5 / 32.9, 10 HP at 7.5 / 43.06 |
| **≤ 6 HP** | one slot top and bottom on **opposite corners**, top right and bottom left. One screw per rail is enough at that width, and diagonal placement stops the module pivoting. |

The 7.5 mm inset is the datum and the grid steps out from it, so the far margin lands at
7.26–7.44 rather than exactly 7.5. That is the way round that matters: the grid is what the
rail is drilled to.

Where the panel is inherited (above), its existing mounting holes win — a v2.2-era panel with
round Ø3.2 holes keeps them.

## The wordmark

**The mark names who designed the module.**

| the design is | the panel says |
|---|---|
| mine, original | `MISSING MILE MODULAR` — `MMM` where the width does not allow it |
| a port or revision of someone else's | that maker's name — `KASSUTRONICS`, `KT` on 4 HP |
| this precision adder | `508`, which is what the built v2.2 panel carries, kept for continuity |

Whatever the word, it is letterspaced inside a plain two-lead component frame — the same
schematic-fragment idea as RYO's, a different part. It sits at `height − 7.0`, above the
mounting line, because a 6.4 mm slot leaves only 17.8 mm between the bottom pair and a full
wordmark needs 19.0. At 4 HP the bottom margin has only ~7 mm of clear width, which is what
the short forms are for.

## Screw holes

3.4 mm holes fix the board behind the panel. They are drilled and then ignored: they need no
layout entry, take no label and get no marks. Mounting slots are treated the same way.

## The star-field

Off. The reference's scatter reads as texture because it covers a whole panel edge to edge;
here, once the keepouts around holes, wires, brackets and type have taken their share, there
is nothing left but orphans — measured, 15 of 17 survivors on Slope had no near neighbour,
and the ASR had none at all. An orphan dot reads as fab dirt. The travel rings already carry
the polar-dot language.

It stays available, and a panel that turns out to have real open space can opt back in.

## Per-module cases

Rules that exist for one panel and are recorded so they are not mistaken for house style.

**The Kassutronics Quantizer's glyphs.** Its shift layer is iconographic, and those icons are
what its user manual teaches, so they are redrawn rather than replaced with words — twelve of
them, each built in a local box running -1..1 from the same strokes and arcs as everything
else and scaled on placement:

| button | glyph | function |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `gate_length` | gate length — a crotchet and a minim, a short note and a long one |
| 1 | `rotate` | rotate menu |
| 2 / 3 | `transpose_both` / `transpose_one` | transpose |
| 4 / 5 | `offset_both` / `offset_one` | offset |
| 6 | `keyboard` | keyboard mode |
| 7 | `legato` | legato — two crotchets under a slur |
| 8 | `gear` | settings |
| 9 | `tau` | gate length |
| 10 / 11 | `cv_a` / `cv_b` | CV A / CV B menus |

The "both channels" glyphs carry two marks where the "one channel" ones carry one — the
distinction the original draws, and the one the manual describes. `tau` is drawn rather than
set, so it cannot depend on the stroke font carrying Greek.

**The keyboard ring inverts.** The original fills the five *black* keys as wedges on a white
panel. Straight onto black soldermask that reading breaks, so the seven **white** keys are
filled instead and the black keys are left as bare panel — same keyboard, same contrast,
opposite ink. Adjacent white keys (E–F, B–C) merge into one shape, as on a real keyboard.
Each wedge subtracts its own scale button's hole with clearance rather than printing over it.
The numbers moved outside the keyboard ring to make room, and **3 and 9 are omitted** — they
sit dead on the panel edges, exactly as on the original.

## Checking a panel

For a generated panel, start from a stub with every hole classified by diameter and each
label `TODO`; the build skips any layout still containing `TODO`.

```sh
python3 tools/panel_compose.py --stub documentation/Foo/Foo.panel.json
```

Then, in this order, however the panel was made:

1. **every control matched and every hole accounted for** — no unmatched control, no
   unaccounted hole;
2. **hole positions identical to the board's.** Compare against the drill file, not against
   the last drawing;
3. **no collisions.** For a KiCad panel, `kicad-cli pcb drc` reports **zero** violations —
   not "warnings only", since the keepouts are under our control and anything surviving is
   real. For a drawn panel, print at 100%, check the sheet measures what the drawing claims,
   and check clearance on anything unproven by an existing build;
4. **rasterise it and look at it.**

## Versioning

**Any change to this document increments the version by one hundredth** — v1.01 → v1.02 →
v1.03, and so on. There is no distinction between a typo and a new rule; every edit is a
bump.

Two things move together, and a change that touches only one of them is incomplete:

1. the version line at the top of this file;
2. the filename — `PANEL_STYLE_v1.01.md` → `PANEL_STYLE_v1.02.md`. Rename with `git mv` so
   the history follows the file.

Then update anything pointing at the old filename (`README.md`).
